# Library-Management-System Project using SQL

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Library Management System  
**Level**: Intermediate  
**Database**: `library_db`

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

A Library Management System designed to efficiently manage library operations, including managing books, members, and borrowing/returning processes. This project is aimed at automating and simplifying library workflows using modern tools and technologies.

## Objectives


1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

 ## Features

- **User Management**: Add, edit, and remove library members.
- **Book Management**: Add, edit, and remove books from the library catalog.
- **Borrow/Return Management**: Track the borrowing and returning of books.
- **Search Functionality**: Search books and members using various filters.
- **Report Generation**: Generate reports for overdue books and borrowing history.
